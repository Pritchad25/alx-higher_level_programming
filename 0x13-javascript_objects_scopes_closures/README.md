## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand and implement JavaScript Objects and Closures and also understand the different kinds of scopes in JavaScript.

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- How to create an object in JavaScript
- What `this` means
- What `undefined` means
- Why the variable type and scope is important
- What is a closure
- What is a prototype
- How to inherit an object from another

- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `node` (version 14.x)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should be `semistandard` compliant (version 16.x.x).
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- You are not allowed to use `var`
