This directory contains the programming solutions to the tasks of the 0x14 JavaScript Web Scraping project which was one at the ALX Holberton Software Engineering School. While doing this project, I learnt:
-Why JavaScript programming is amazing
-How to manipulate JSON data
-How to use request and fetch API
-How to read and write a file using fs module.
