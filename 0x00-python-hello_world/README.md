## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand and implement Fundamental Python Constructs.

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone without the help of Google:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- Who created Python
- Who is Guido van Rossum
- Where does the name ‘Python’ come from
- What is the Zen of Python
- How to use the Python interpreter
- How to print text and variables using `print`
- How to use strings
- What are indexing and slicing in Python
- What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with `pycodestyle`

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
## Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
## Shell Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (`wc -l file` should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- All your files must be executable
## C Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style, that is, it should be betty compliant
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
