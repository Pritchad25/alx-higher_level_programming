## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand and implement Core Networking Constructs and Functionalities using Python.

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- What a URL is
- What HTTP is
- How to read a URL
- The scheme for a HTTP URL
- What a domain name is
- What a sub-domain is
- How to define a port number in a URL
- What a query string is
- What an HTTP request is
- What an HTTP response is
- What HTTP headers are
- What the HTTP message body is
- What an HTTP request method is
- What an HTTP response status code is
- What an HTTP Cookie is
- How to make a request with cURL
- What happens when you type google.com in your browser (Application level)

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- All your files must be executable
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your Bash scripts should be exactly 3 lines long (`wc -l file` should print 3)
- The first line of all your bash files should be exactly `#!/bin/bash`
- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
- All `curl` commands must have the option `-s` (silent mode)
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
