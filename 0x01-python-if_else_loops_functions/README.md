## About <a name="about"></a>
This project is part of the curriculum of the ALX Software Engineering program. The main objective of this project is to understand and implement Control Structures and Procedural Programming using Python

## Learning Objectives <a name="learning-objectives"></a>
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- Why indentation is so important in Python
- How to use the `if`, `if ... else` statements
- How to use comments
- How to affect values to variables
- How to use the `while` and `for` loops
- How is Python’s `for` different from `C`‘s?
- How to use the `break` and `continues` statements
- How to use `else` clauses on loops
- What does the `pass` statement do, and when to use it
- How to use `range`
- What is a function and how do you use functions
- What does return a function that does not use any `return` statement
- Scope of variables
- What’s a traceback
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them

## Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
## Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
## C Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style, that is, it should be betty compliant
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
